### Organizing a retreat

Retreats are an important part of Mangrove. Mangrove was born on a retreat in January 2016 in Essaouira, Morocco. Retreats are a time to step back from your daily life and get out of your comfort zone to experiment for 3-weeks co-living with the Mangrove Friends community.

Learn here how to set up and live a perfect Mangrove retreat [add Portugal templates as an example (no need to reformat it for now):

**The spot**

First, youâ€™ll have to talk to the Mangrove Builders and get their approval to set up a brand new retreat. Once you get the approval of 80% of the team about the dates and the city, you will be in charge of finding the perfect house to rent.

Here are the points you have to check while searching the house:

- very good WIFI
- a quiet place
- a dishwasher
- some good waves

Once youâ€™ve found at least 3 perfect matches, share your find with the Mangrove community to validate the final house.

**The guests**

Guests can come for 1 week and have to be a Mangrove Friend. Youâ€™ll have to announce the retreat to all the MF at least 3 months before the startd date. To do that, create a Google Doc including information about the spot, the surroundings, the mindset, the rates and a brief explanation of the payment method.

Each guest stays around 1 week in the house so each week we can host a new batch. Try to have well-diversified batches. Once you have more than 30% of the house filled, you can proceed with booking the house.

**The booking**

If you can pay in advance, let the community know that youâ€™re ready to pay for the house. If youâ€™re not able to pay in advance, talk to the community to find someone who can pay for the house. Then, you have to pay back this member by asking the first batch of Mangrove Friends to pay their rent [see buying something for Mangrove]

**The planning**

Create a shared Google sheet to manage the batch. You will have to ask the participants to choose their ideal week. Once someone has chosen their dates, you can directly proceed to the payment and confirm the venue.

**The survival kit**

You must send out a survival kit (Google Doc) to each participant with at least the following information:

- Your phone number
- Emergency number
- Transportation from the Airport to the house
- Map of the house's surroundings

**The co-living**

As a retreat coach, youâ€™ll ensure that:

- The house is ready to host all of the participants each week (house, bed, and towels are clean)
- To invite the closest tech community to join us for a BBQ ðŸŒ­
- The participants are feeling amazing during their stay.
