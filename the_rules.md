# The rules


### Daily Routine

Like every company, we have a daily routine. The only difference is that it’s not about drinking coffee or bitching about our boss. It’s lighter but present, everyday.


****1 - Pairing****

Every week, the Pairing Dancers give you a new buddy. Call him/her 10 minutes everyday from monday to friday. You can talk about your day, both pro and personal, if you feel comfortable with it. Listening is as important as talking.

> Tips: Make sure to get in touch on monday to set the ideal time for a call during the week.



**2 - #missions**

If you bill a new mission to a client, write a brief summary on #missions. It helps you take a step back on how you’re doing as a freelancer, and can create synergies between members for future collaborations.

Ex:

      Startup Name

      1200$ per month 
      4 hours per week
      - 3 Facebook posts per week
      - 3 tweets per week (and some RT and Like for the other days)
      - 1 daily check for the comments and questions (PM)



**3 - #debrief**

When you meet someone interesting, write a short debrief. It helps you keep track of the people you meet, and creates connexions between Mangrove members.

Key elements:
- who did you meet?
- what did you talk about?
- is there an opportunity for you? for Mangrove?

Ex:

    Skype with Pedro X, launching a fintech startup
    - Nice guy, I used to work with him at YYY
    - He’s launching a fintech startup similar to Number26
    - It’s still really early stage but he’s planning to begin by gathering bank accounts in one place and let people spare on a virtual jackpot.
    - Looking for a CTO.
    => Will need help on UX and code soon. Maybe a mission for some of us.


** 4 - When on a Mangrove retreat, education or event
**
Mangrove members are responsible for what’s happening and take responsibilities.

Ex:
     -  Internet is not working. Mangrove members in the room find a solution.
      - There are more people sleeping in the house than planned. Some mangrove members decide to sleep on the couch to let guest have beds.


### Integrating new members

After sharing a retreat or a project with a Mangrove Friend, we can decide to integrate him/her to our core team.

The question is raised by a Mangrove member and all members must approve it.


> When Mangrove reaches 10 members, we'll switch to 5 randomly chosen Mangrove members.

Here are the main points that must be checked before admitting someone:

1. Is he/she sharing our values? Does he/she believe in the vision we're trying to build?
2. Has he/she proved his/her will to get involved on a daily basis in the building of Mangrove in the long-term?
3. Does he/she has an entrepreneurial mindset? 

> Side projects are a good way to evaluate this.


4. Does he/she possess amazing skills in his/her field ?
5. Would it be ok to have that person as a leader of Mangrove project?




### Internal processes
**Huddles hebdomadaires**
   - mood standups, 5min/pers : Pro, freelance & projects (past & to come), mangrove, perso
   - necessary debriefings, discussions about important topics, decisions for the future

**Pairing**


### Projets management
- Responsibilities publicly and clearly identified
- No interventionism in projects of which another member is responsible. Don't judge things in progress or the way they are executed
- evaluate results according to the commitments taken 

### Taking parts in projects
Two ways of participating :
- Publicly taking the responsibility of a project or a subproject. Duty of transparency concerning how a project is going. duty of information of the community according to the commitments taken towards it. One is not accountable to a member in particular.
  -> list the responsibilities taken, visible by everyone (currently : Trello)
- Participating to a project led by another member without taking any public responsibility. Accountable to this member according to the commitment taken

### Debriefings
- The meetings related to mangrove, and the important actions done for Mangrove are subject to a written debirefing shared internally - the quicker the better.

### Commissions
- When a member brings business to another member, she/he can ask for a commission
- The percentage or amount of this commission is negociated ad hoc between the two parts and publicly shared in Mangrove
- The history of the preceeding negociations serves as a basis for 

### Integrating new members
- Unanimous validation (+1 or abstains, be no -1)
- Recruitment questions :
    -> show how do recognize yourself particularly in these values. the one on which you can improve most. which one have you encountered the most in your pro life ? the less ?
- Validation à l’unanimité (+1 ou s’abstient, mais aucun -1)


### Mangrove Friends
- adding : validated by at least two Mangrove members
