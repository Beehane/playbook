### Projets management
- Responsibilities publicly and clearly identified
- No interventionism in projects of which another member is responsible. Don't judge things in progress or the way they are executed
- evaluate results according to the commitments taken 

### Taking parts in projects
Two ways of participating :
- Publicly taking the responsibility of a project or a subproject. Duty of transparency concerning how a project is going. duty of information of the community according to the commitments taken towards it. One is not accountable to a member in particular.
  -> list the responsibilities taken, visible by everyone (currently : Trello)
- Participating to a project led by another member without taking any public responsibility. Accountable to this member according to the commitment taken

### Debriefings
- The meetings related to mangrove, and the important actions done for Mangrove are subject to a written debirefing shared internally - the quicker the better.

### Commissions
