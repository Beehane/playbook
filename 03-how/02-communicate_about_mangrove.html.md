### Pitching Mangrove

**Type the command **`mangrovepitch` in slack to get access to the last **wording**, and to **pitch videos**.

**Who are you pitching to?** Potential members who are in the startup world? Interested people who are not in this world? Managers of big corporations interested in the way we work? A wide and unknown audience? Depending on the answer, **the words you use** and the **facts & ideas you highlight** should not be the same.

Here are a few tips for a better pitch:

1. **Show that you know your audience:**

   1. Use **their** words.

      If you are talking to a fellow startuper, you will use the words "slack", "bot", "members".

      > eg: For corporate people, our nomad education is close to a 'seminar'. Slack is the equivalent of their 'internal social network'. Their closest experience to a 'member' is a 'colleague', and the 'organisation' is the 'company'. A 'bot' can be called a 'robot' for someone who never heard of bots.

   2. Connect to **their** preoccupations.

      > eg: the flexibility we offer can have very different advantages for different people. To a young graduate, tell how it allows you to discover the world and keep personal projects while working. To a young parent, tell how it helps you to choose your working hours and be more present at important times for your family and children.

      > eg: corporate people often don't have directly the 'personal fulfilment' preoccupation, but the 'human resources' preoccupation is central to them. And both can be easily connected.

   3. Use **examples** they can **relate to**, or bridge your examples to theirs.

2. Show that you **already know how their perceive you**.

   > eg: If you are talking for people of all ages and all backgrounds, they will see us as "young people from the startup world". So say in your intro "we are a team of young startupers". But if you are talking to young graduates, don't say we're "young", they don't see us like that. They just see us as "startupers".

3. When there are **two sides** of a same thing, always present the side that speaks to them.

   > eg: the pairing process can lead to personal or professional talks. Corporate people are mostly interested in business efficiency: show that it can help someone stuck in his project to get out of isolation. But if you talk to someone interested in personal development, talk about how feedbacks help to grow.

   > eg: you can present our openness in terms of ideal: that we deeply believe that more openness is necessary for a more fulfilling society, and how it connects to our values. But to someone else only interested in mechanisms, you can present it under the light of one of its effects, as a powerful tool of inbound marketing.

1. Try to **conclude** on some **takeaways** that can be useful for them in particular.

1. **Learn** from the **reactions** after your pitch. The first questions or remarks that often come up should be answered, directly or indirectly, in your next presentations.

   > eg: the question of the possibility to go to the retreats when one has a family life often comes up. Incorporate in your deck a picture of a father with his child in a retreat, and the brain of your audience won't be busy with this question anymore. This way, your pitch will be stronger each time

### Handling our social media accounts

Each month, two community leaders are appointed by the Mangrove members on Slack.
The first one is responsible for maintaining our social media active with a fluid publication calendar. The second one has to manage and answer the Mangrove emails.

Community leaders are also responsible for keeping a consistent editorial line. They must be proactive and create most of the content while carrying out their duties.

That being said, each member may create content for the Mangrove social media accounts. All posts must serve the interest of the Mangrove community. In other words, there should be no personal projects unless it's in the Mangrove vision. As a Mangrove member, if you want to publish a content, you must refer to the current community lead. They are the only one who can decide the publication timing, and give you the final approval.

Besides, feel free to use our mailing list by using Mailchimp. Follow the previous templates. If you need the password, contact the community lead by private message on Slack.
