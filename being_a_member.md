# Being a member

Being a member of Mangrove means



### Always keeping in mind its purpose 

Always keeping in mind the purpose of the organization is the core engine of Teal Organizations. The only final boss of Mangrove's members is Mangrove's purpose, and only important decision should be made under the light of this purpose. Member's work should converge towards it.


### Sharing its ideal and its convictions

Members sharing a common strong culture is at the very root of Mangrove's existence. Before everything else, a member shares with Mangrove an ideal of what is a fulfiling professional life, and Mangrove's convictions on how to achieve it.


### Adhering to its rules and habits, and helping improving them
- pairing
- 'empty seat technique', representing the purpose during decision making meetings

### Experimenting together
Experimenting together new modes of organization and governance
- governance in Mangrove is decentralized. Currently, we do X Y Z (eg : freedom of taking initiatives ; immediate transparency about most actions)
- how projects work : project leaders gathering 'project circles'. Possibility of having coaches


### Being implied in the life and the construction of the ecosystem

- integrating to the community and to its everyday life
- putting one's skills and resources to the service of the community
- being proactive, undertaking initiatives and being a driving force of projects aligned with Mangrove's shared vision

### Representing the ecosystem
- embody its values and and its ideal, during highlight moments as well as in everday life
