# Mangrove Friends


### Onboarding a mangrove friend
After 2 Mangrove members agreed on inviting a new person to the community because she shares our values and works in the tech industry, one of them needs to explain her what is the MF community and ask her if she wants to join. If she agrees, she has to fill this form: [http://bit.ly/newmf_](http://bit.ly/newmf_)

Then, the 1st member who suggested her as an MF will add her on the MF Slack and write an introduction in #general as soon as she joins.
Ex: Hey all, I’m glad to introduce you to [name]. I met her/him [somewhere]. (S)he’s skilled at [top 3 skills]. Her/his background in a few words [///]. Follow her on Twitter here: [account].

Then, this same member will send the new MF a private message to:
- ask her to add a profile picture as it's more friendly
- share with her the link to the MF directory ([http://bit.ly/MF_directory](http://bit.ly/MF_directory)) and tell her not to hesitate to get in touch with anyone in the community
- share with her the Slack channels that could be interesting to her (for instance: #dev, #ux, etc.)
Here is an example of message you can send her to tell her all this : http://bit.ly/welcome_MF


### Animating mangrove friends

As a Mangrove member, you'll have to ensure that the MF community is well-animated by posting regularly, giving feedbacks and helping people.
