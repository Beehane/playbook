# Routines


### Daily Routine

Like every company, we have a daily routine. The only difference is that it’s not about drinking coffee or bitching about our boss. It’s lighter but present, everyday.


****1 - Pairing****

Every week, the Pairing Dancers give you a new buddy. Call him/her 10 minutes everyday from monday to friday. You can talk about your day, both pro and personal, if you feel comfortable with it. Listening is as important as talking.

> Tips: Make sure to get in touch on monday to set the ideal time for a call during the week.



**2 - #missions**

If you bill a new mission to a client, write a brief summary on #missions. It helps you take a step back on how you’re doing as a freelancer, and can create synergies between members for future collaborations.

Ex:

      Startup Name

      1200$ per month 
      4 hours per week
      - 3 Facebook posts per week
      - 3 tweets per week (and some RT and Like for the other days)
      - 1 daily check for the comments and questions (PM)



**3 - #debrief**

When you meet someone interesting, write a short debrief. It helps you keep track of the people you meet, and creates connexions between Mangrove members.

Key elements:
- who did you meet?
- what did you talk about?
- is there an opportunity for you? for Mangrove?

Ex:

    Skype with Pedro X, launching a fintech startup
    - Nice guy, I used to work with him at YYY
    - He’s launching a fintech startup similar to Number26
    - It’s still really early stage but he’s planning to begin by gathering bank accounts in one place and let people spare on a virtual jackpot.
    - Looking for a CTO.
    => Will need help on UX and code soon. Maybe a mission for some of us.


** 4 - When on a Mangrove retreat, education or event
**
Mangrove members are responsible for what’s happening and take responsibilities.

Ex:
     -  Internet is not working. Mangrove members in the room find a solution.
      - There are more people sleeping in the house than planned. Some mangrove members decide to sleep on the couch to let guest have beds.


### Weekly meetings
Online or offline.
The goal of these meetings is to share with everyone your mood, what you have done for Mangrove in the last 7 days and what is next (5-10 min/person).
Every Mangrove member is expected to attend more than 3/4 of weekly meetings and shouldn't miss 2 meetings in a row (except if on vacation).
If she cannot attend, she needs to share publicly the information before the meeting.
