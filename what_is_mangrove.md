# What is Mangrove

Mangrove is an ecosystem of freelancers sharing the same ideal of professional fulfillment. It experiments a new way of working following this ideal, and brings into its wake all those who are sensitive to it.

It is not owned by anyone and has no leaders. It is close to what is sometimes described as a Teal Organization.

Mangrove friends are people revolving around Mangrove. They share the mindset, the vision and are interested in being part of the ecosystem.
