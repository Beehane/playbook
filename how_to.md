# How To

### Organize a retreat


A retreat is an important part of Mangrove: itâ€™s actually where Mangrove was born in January 2016 in Essaouira, Morocco. Itâ€™s a time to step back from your daily life and get out of your comfort zone to experiment a 3-weeks co-living with the Mangrove Friends community.

Learn here how to set up and live a perfect Mangrove retreat [add Portugal templates as an example (no need to reformat it for now):


**The spot**

First, youâ€™ll have to talk with the Mangrove members and get their approval about building a brand new retreat. Once you get the approval of 80% of the team about the dates and the city, you will be in charge to find the perfect house to rent.

Hereâ€™s the points you have to check while searching the house:
- a very good WIFI
- a quiet place
- a dishwasher
- some good waves 

Once youâ€™ve found at least 3 perfect matches, share your find with the Mangrove community to validate the finale house.

**The guests**

A guest is coming for 1 week and has to be a Mangrove Friends. Youâ€™ll have to announce the retreat to all the MF at least 3 months before the start. To do this, create a Google Doc including informations about the spot, the surroundings, the mindset, the rates and a brief explanation about the payment method. 

Each guest stay around 1 week in the house so each week we can host a new batch. Once you have more than 30% of the house filled, you can proceed to the house booking. 

Keep in mind to have well-diversified batchs.

**The booking**

If you can pay in advance, just warn the community youâ€™re ready to pay the house. If youâ€™re not able to advance the fees, you will talk with the community to find someone who can pay the house. Then, you have to pay back this member by asking the first Mangrove Friends to pay their rent [see buying something for Mangrove] 

**The planning**

Create a shared Google sheet to manage the batch. You will have to ask to the participants to choose their ideal week. Once someone have chosen his dates, you can directly proceed to the payment and confirm his venue.

**The survival kit**

Each participants will receive from you a survival kit (Google Doc) with useful information:
- Your phone number
- Urgency number
- Transports from the Airport to the house
- Map of the house surroundings

**The co-living**

As a retreat coach, youâ€™ll ensure that: 
- The house is ready to host all of the participant each week (house, bed, and towels are clean)
- To invite the closest tech community to join us for a BBQ ðŸŒ­
- The participants is feeling amazed during their stay.


### Organize a Monthly Meeting

The monthly meetings have been created to gather our freelance & entrepreneurs friends who share our mindset but also those interested in learning more about our community.

Learn here how to set up a Mangrove Monthly meeting:

**The spot**

As a monthly meeting leader, youâ€™re in charge of booking a bar with a capacity of 70+ people (depending on the community size in your hub). Pick a selection of 3 bars on the date that best suit and let the Mangrove community vote.

**The guest**

Everybody is welcome to join us to talk about new lifestyles and meet awesome freelancers, entrepreneurs and people who want to work differently. 

**The announcement**

- **Facebook Event** : create a Facebook event to measure the number of attendees
- **Facebook Posts** : publish two posts on the Mangrove Facebook page to let our fans know about the event (you can find some samples in the Google Drive)
- **Twitter** : publish two tweets on the Mangrove twitter account to let the community know about the event
- **Newsletter** : send one newsletter to the Mangrove mailing list the week before the event to let the suscribers know about the event.
- **Mangrove Friends** : publish a message in the Mangrove Friends Slack to help us to create a huge word of mouth.

**The D-Day**

Be sure to be the first at the bar to welcome the guest. Make yourself available and donâ€™t hesitate to discuss with the first-time people. 


### Handle our social media accounts

Each member may create content for the Mangrove social media accounts. All posts must serve the interest of the Mangrove community. In other words, there should be no personal projects unless it's in the Mangrove spirit.

Each 6 months, a community leader is appoint by the Mangrove members. His role is too handle a fluid publication calendar. 

As a Mangrove member, if you want to publish a content, you must refer to the community lead - he is the only one who can decide the publication timing, and give you the final approval. Once you know the publication timing, you can publish the content by yourself.

If you need the password, contact the community lead by private message on Slack.

Using emoji is highly recommended ðŸ’™

### Impact existing assets
Existing assets include: website, bots, branding.
Ask the advice of the person leading the asset and other members who are expert on the topic about the change youâ€™d like to make.
If you still want to make it and some people are against, ask for a vote (each voter being pondered by each memberâ€™s public influence based on contribution) and if you get less than 30% of voters against the change (yes, no, IDK), you can make it.


### Deal with our mailing list


### Onboard a new member
Every new member gets to choose 2 mentors who are gonna have a weekly call with her. They are supposed to provide the help needed on a personal level (Mangrove integration, mood) & on a professional level (projects & revenue).
After 3 months, the new member picks publicly 10 people that are supposed to decide if she should become a confirmed Mangrove member. These 10 people vote anonymously (yes, no, IDK). If there is less than 7 yes, this member becomes a Mangrove friend.

### Buy something for mangrove

When it has been decided that something has to be bought by you for Mangrove, please consider the following steps: 

1. Choose the best item regarding the needs
2. Validate it with your team on the associated project
3. If you have enough money to buy it, go for it. If not, divide the total amount with other teammates. Announce the expense in the #finance channel so that the treasurer can take it into account. 
4. Every month (?), finances are publicly communicated by the treasurer in order to balance the member contributions, so you can see who owes you money. However, you are responsible to ask for your refunds, and if needed, go through a conflict resolution process [see link]


### Onboard a mangrove friend
