# Monthly Meetings

### Organizing a Monthly Meeting

The monthly meetings have been created to gather our freelance & entrepreneurs friends who share our mindset but also those interested in learning more about our community.

Learn here how to set up a Mangrove Monthly meeting:

**The spot**

As a monthly meeting leader, you’re in charge of booking a bar with a capacity of 70+ people (depending on the community size in your hub). Pick a selection of 3 bars on the date that best suit and let the Mangrove community vote.

**The guests**

Everybody is welcome to join us to talk about new lifestyles and meet awesome freelancers, entrepreneurs and people who want to work differently. 

**The announcement**

- **Facebook Event** : create a Facebook event to measure the number of attendees
- **Facebook Posts** : publish two posts on the Mangrove Facebook page to let our fans know about the event (you can find some samples in the Google Drive)
- **Twitter** : publish two tweets on the Mangrove twitter account to let the community know about the event
- **Newsletter** : send one newsletter to the Mangrove mailing list the week before the event to let the suscribers know about the event.
- **Mangrove Friends** : publish a message in the Mangrove Friends Slack to help us to create a huge word of mouth.

**The D-Day**

Be sure to be the first at the bar to welcome the guest. Make yourself available and don’t hesitate to discuss with the first-time people. 

Make sure to have a good **camera** to document the event and that someone takes the responsibility for the pictures :)
