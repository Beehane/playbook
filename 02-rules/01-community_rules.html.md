### Commissions between members

When a member brings business to another member, she/he can ask for a commission when the exchange is not equilibrated. The percentage or amount of this commission is negotiated ad hoc between the two parts, and publicly shared in Mangrove to serve as a basis for future cases. The negotiation should be based on the history of previous cases.
