# Contribution

### Starting a new project

When you want to start a new project, you need to:

* ask for advice from the people who will get impacted by your project.
* ask for advice from the people who are the most skilled to help you.
* share publicly about the project you are starting if people want to participate.

### Impacting existing assets

Existing assets include: website, bots, branding.  
Ask the advice of the person leading the asset and other members who are expert on the topic about the change you’d like to make.  
If some member are against this change and you still want to make it, ask for a vote. Each vote is weighted by each member’s decisional power based on their contribution.  If you get less than 30% of voters against the change \(yes, no, IDK\), you can make it.

### Recording your contribution & contribution points \(CP\)

Every week on Monday, a reminder is sent on Slack for the members to record their contribution through the right Typeform \(enter Slack command "contributionpoints" to get the links to the Typeform & spreadsheet with the list of contributions\).

Spending 1 hour on Mangrove projects : 1 contribution point \(cp\).  
4 hours: 2 cp.  
1 whole day: 5 cp.  
1.5 day: 1.5 cp.

When a member participates in the Mangrove Shipping Day, meaning that they dedicate their whole Monday to Mangrove work, they get an additional bonus point \(+1 cp\).

When a member has an exceptionnal impact with their work, they get 3 additional bonus points \(+3 cp\). Exceptionnal impact means that their involvement significantly helped Mangrove grow.

Every month, 3 members are picked randomly to check that the recorded contribution is aligned with the actual contribution. This group can encourage members to revise their recorded contribution, in order to add or remove points. They share a report publicly after this process so the community can know which updates happened.

The minimum monthly contribution is 15 cp \(except if time-off\). If a member doesn't reach this threshold, the 3 members who were picked randomly to check the contribution points this month have to discuss the situation with this member and make sure it doesn't happen again. Each time a member doesn't reach the 15cp,  this group also have to share the information to the rest of the community which can lead to other decisions regarding the member's involvement as a Mangrove member.
