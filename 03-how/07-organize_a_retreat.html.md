### Organizing a retreat

Retreats are an important part of Mangrove. Mangrove was born on a retreat in January 2016 in Essaouira, Morocco. Retreats are a time to step back from your daily life and get out of your comfort zone to experiment for 3-weeks co-living.

**The organizer**

The retreat organizer is responsible of making the retreat a success. If you want to know more about our organization process, learn here how we set up a perfect retreat at Mangrove: https://trello.com/b/MZTrLlOI/leading-a-retreat

**The guests**

At this time, the retreats are dedicated to the Mangrove community.  
Guests can come for 1 week or so while the Builders are allowed to stay 3 weeks in a row.
