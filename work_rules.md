# Work and Decision Rules



### Responsibility

Having members taking clearly defined responsibilities and assuming them is key for Mangrove. It is the condition for a flat organisation to work, and goes hand in hand with the freedom of action. There are two ways of taking a responsibility within Mangrove :
- **public responsibility**. In this option, the responsibility is publicly documented, including the deadlines or the expected outcomes (currently in Trello). The member is accountable to Mangrove is general for this, and to no one in particular. Therefore, no one should act as a manager on her or pressure her about it. It is her duty to communicate actively and regularly about the updates concerning her responsibility, and to particularly do it towards the others member who are impacted by her activity.
- **private responsibility**. Often, someone who bears an important responsibility like organising a retreat cannot do the work alone and needs the help of others. This help can sometimes be too small to be subject to a formal public responsibility, like just sending an important email. In this case, the helper takes a private responsibility towards the member having the public responsibility. He is then accountable to her for this commitment.

In both cases, the members should not be judged on the way they accomplish their works, but only on the promised outcomes.


### Projects in Mangrove

Projects are not subjects to formalism and rules like responsibilities are. Responsibilities management only is the cornerstone of Mangrove’s activity. “Project” is just a handy word to talk about a main activity that is being conducted at the moment.

A project can be handled and managed in many different ways, and include several or many members. Some examples are :
- having an identified leader responsible for its avancement, which ensures that it will be conducted to the end. This management mode is necessary when the project is really mandatory for Mangrove, on when commitments have to be taken, like when organising a monthly meeting or a retreat.
- being something that members talk about and work on, without clear management, like working on a new bot. In this case, the outcome is not guaranteed, and will be the resultant of the energy and will of the members. This is management mode is a very good way for Mangrove to listen to its inner self, instead of working on actions planned according to a strategy.



### Mangrove Ownership Points
Contributing to Mangrove gives the right to accumulate Mangrove Ownership Points (MOP). This points are not legal ownership rights like are shareholder's actions, but gives you weight in Mangrove's inner workings. 
At the beginning of each month, you write a text about your contribution to the ecosystem during the month before, and attribute yourself points for that. These points are publicly shared on slack and an harmonization discussion happens there involving all the MM. If needed or if the subject is complex, an appear.in will be scheduled for this purpose.
> when the number of MM will exceed 10, this process will no more involve all the community at one time
At the end, you are free to attribute yourself the number of points you want ; but it is highly recommanded that you follow what the community suggested on this matter if it had remarks on your amount.
The points give you more weight in the decision making process
