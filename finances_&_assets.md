# Finances & Assets



### Physical Assets

While all assets belong to Mangrove, a person is appointed as responsible for a period of time to be determined, depending on the context. Being responsible of an asset means that we have to take care of it [link to sheperding], in exchange of its use. 

When a member leaves Mangrove, he takes no assets back. He has to delegate the responsibilities he has over the physical assets to other members. He has to seek advice with people directly concerned with this transmission. 

A member cannot use Mangrove physical assets for personal use, as it doesn’t help the purpose of Mangrove. However, he can ask to affected members to buy or lease it with associated guarantees.

### Money Management
All profits generated within Mangrove should be reinvested in other Mangrove projects. (ça suppose quand même que mangrove possède un statut juridique et peut recevoir de l’argent)

When money is needed for a project, the people in charge of the project can simply ask in the #finance channel the required amount in order to discuss the potential investment.

A treasurer has to be elected every 3 months and is hold responsible of the financial flows. He has to regularly check the #finance channel in order to register the cashflows on his favorite accounting system (we like google spreadsheets, lydia and tricount) and publicly communicate the balances every 2 weeks, the debts of Mangrove towards its members, and the distribution of the refunds.
