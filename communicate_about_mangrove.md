### Pitching Mangrove

3 values : trust, freedom & goodwill


### Handling our social media accounts

Each month, two community leaders are appointed by the Mangrove members on Slack.
The first one is responsible for maintaining our social media active with a fluid publication calendar. The second one has to manage and answer the Mangrove emails.

Community leaders are also responsible for keeping a consistent editorial line. They must be proactive and create most of the content while carrying out their duties. 

That being said, each member may create content for the Mangrove social media accounts. All posts must serve the interest of the Mangrove community. In other words, there should be no personal projects unless it's in the Mangrove vision. As a Mangrove member, if you want to publish a content, you must refer to the current community lead. They are the only one who can decide the publication timing, and give you the final approval.

Besides, feel free to use our mailing list by using Mailchimp. Follow the previous templates. If you need the password, contact the community lead by private message on Slack.
