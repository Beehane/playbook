# Playbook


### Modifying the Playbook

Any MM can modify the "how to" part of the playbook. He/she must talk about the changes in #playbook.

Changes in "What is Mangrove", "Being a member" and "The rules" need the approval of the overall community (only +1 or 0, no -1).

> When we'll reach 20 members, an absolute number of point will be necessary to edit these parts.

Request access in #playbook to begin editing. Yolo
