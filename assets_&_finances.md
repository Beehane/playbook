### Buying something for mangrove

When it has been decided that something has to be bought by you for Mangrove, please consider the following steps: 

1. Choose the best item regarding the needs
2. Validate it with your team on the associated project
3. If you have enough money to buy it, go for it. If not, divide the total amount with other teammates. Announce the expense in the #finance channel so that the treasurer can take it into account. 
4. Every month (?), finances are publicly communicated by the treasurer in order to balance the member contributions, so you can see who owes you money. However, you are responsible to ask for your refunds, and if needed, go through a conflict resolution process [see link]
