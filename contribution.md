# Contribution


### Starting a new project
When you want to start a new project, you need to:
- ask for advice from the people who will get impacted by your project.
- ask for advice from the people who are the most skilled to help you.
- share publicly about the project you are starting if people want to participate.


### Impacting existing assets
Existing assets include: website, bots, branding.
Ask the advice of the person leading the asset and other members who are expert on the topic about the change you’d like to make.
If you still want to make it and some people are against, ask for a vote (each voter being pondered by each member’s public influence based on contribution) and if you get less than 30% of voters against the change (yes, no, IDK), you can make it.
