# Decision Rules


### Decision Making
Mangrove is based on freedom, transparency, and a strong sense of collectiveness. Therefore in most of the cases, you can make your own decisions, ensuring that :
1. they follow Mangrove's purpose
2. you consult the relevant advisors about them, and/or the members who will be impacted
3. your promptly inform the members about your decisions (via slack)

Nevertheless, some important decisions must be validated by the members. This is done by a vote in which the memberâ€™s weights are the amount of Mangrove Points their own. These decisions are :
1. Modifying the playbook, except for the "how to" section.
2. Making an important investment
3. Selling an asset
