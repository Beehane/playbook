# The rules




### Office and hubs

**1 - The office**

Mangrove members are free to work from wherever they want. However, we have an office in Paris at the Liberté Living Lab. If you want to take a seat at this office, you’ll have to get involved in life of the Lab by introducing Mangrove regularly to different companies or by working several hours for the Lab on a monthly basis. 

**2 - Hubs**

As an MM, you’re welcome to create hubs all around the world. Mangrove hubs are gathering members in a common city. For example, if 4 members are located in Austin, TX, they can create a Mangrove hub there by finding an office and working together. 


### Modifying the Playbook

Any MM can modify the "how to" part of the playbook. He/she must talk about the changes in #playbook.

Changes in "What is Mangrove", "Being a member" and "The rules" need the approval of the overall community (only +1 or 0, no -1).

> When we'll reach 20 members, an absolute number of point will be necessary to edit these parts.

Request access in #playbook to begin editing.
