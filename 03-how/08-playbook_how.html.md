title: How to update the Playbook
```

The playbook is split into two separate repositories; one for [content](https://github.com/MeetMangrove/playbook) and one for [code](https://github.com/MeetMangrove/playbook-website). Splitting the playbook this way:

1. makes it easy for discussions about the content to be separate from the actual site.
1. separates the implementation for the site from the actual text you are reading allowing us to potentially upgrade or modify the site without affecting the content.

## Content

If you find typos or have suggestions for the content, you can find an "Edit or improve this page!" link at the bottom of the page.
Clicking that will take you to the [repository](https://github.com/MeetMangrove/playbook) on GitHub where you can directly suggest edits to the page content that you were on. To make suggestions to the site, you will need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

You can view active discussions about the playbook content on the [issues tab](https://github.com/MeetMangrove/playbook/issues) on the repository. You can also start a new discussion by [creating an issue](https://github.com/MeetMangrove/playbook/issues/new).

To make edits or suggestions you can follow the instructions below:

The content uses Markdown which you can find out more about by checking the [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). When editing on GitHub you can see the result of the file by clicking on Preview near the top.

### Mangrove Members

As a Mangrove Member part of the Architect track, you can directly make edits to the site.

1. If you're comfortable editing the content, you can directly submit your edits by selecting "commit directly to the master branch".(*)
1. If you're unsure of your edits or the edits need to be reviewed, select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" and submit the form. One or more Mangrove Members can then review your changes and then update the site accordingly.

For finding out what you can edit directly, and what requires review, please refer to the [Playbook Rules](/rules/playbook_rules).

(*) **Important** - this will automatically update the live playbook site. You can confirm the site was updated by checking the build and deployment on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/meetmangrove/playbook-website).

## Mangrove Friends & Others

As a contributor who is not a Mangrove Member, you can still make and suggest edits to the playbook. We really appreciate everyone's contributions and hope you will let us know of any issues you spot or improvements you suggest.

After clicking the "Edit or improve this page!" link at the bottom of the page you are concerned with, you will be able to modify the content directly. After making your changes, submit the form then click "Create Pull Request". Add any comments you need to describe your changes and an appropriate title for them. Your changes will be reviewed by a Mangrove Member and hopefully incorporated into the site.

If you need a more detailed description of how to propose changes, you can also see the instructions from GitHub [here](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/).

## Code / Site

The code for the playbook site is also available in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MeetMangrove/playbook-website). The playbook website is built using [DocPad](https://docpad.org/) and the instructions to get that working are available in the [README file](https://github.com/MeetMangrove/playbook-website/blob/master/README.md).
