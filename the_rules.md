# The rules


### Daily Routine

Like every company, we have a daily routine. The only difference is that it’s not about drinking coffee or bitching about our boss. It’s lighter but present, everyday.


****1 - Pairing****

Every week, the Pairing Dancers give you a new buddy. Call him/her 10 minutes everyday from monday to friday. You can talk about your day, both pro and personal, if you feel comfortable with it. Listening is as important as talking.

> Tips: Make sure to get in touch on monday to set the ideal time for a call during the week.



**2 - #missions**

If you bill a new mission to a client, write a brief summary on #missions. It helps you take a step back on how you’re doing as a freelancer, and can create synergies between members for future collaborations.

Ex:

      Startup Name

      1200$ per month 
      4 hours per week
      - 3 Facebook posts per week
      - 3 tweets per week (and some RT and Like for the other days)
      - 1 daily check for the comments and questions (PM)



**3 - #debrief**

When you meet someone interesting, write a short debrief. It helps you keep track of the people you meet, and creates connexions between Mangrove members.

Key elements:
- who did you meet?
- what did you talk about?
- is there an opportunity for you? for Mangrove?

Ex:

    Skype with Pedro X, launching a fintech startup
    - Nice guy, I used to work with him at YYY
    - He’s launching a fintech startup similar to Number26
    - It’s still really early stage but he’s planning to begin by gathering bank accounts in one place and let people spare on a virtual jackpot.
    - Looking for a CTO.
    => Will need help on UX and code soon. Maybe a mission for some of us.


** 4 - When on a Mangrove retreat, education or event
**
Mangrove members are responsible for what’s happening and take responsibilities.

Ex:
     -  Internet is not working. Mangrove members in the room find a solution.
      - There are more people sleeping in the house than planned. Some mangrove members decide to sleep on the couch to let guest have beds.


### Weekly meetings
Online or offline.
The goal of these meetings is to share with everyone your mood, what you have done for Mangrove in the last 7 days and what is next (5-10 min/person).
Every Mangrove member is expected to attend more than 3/4 of weekly meetings and shouldn't miss 2 meetings in a row (except if on vacation).
If she cannot attend, she needs to share publicly the information before the meeting.
  
### Vacations
Up to 5 weeks without being implied in Mangrove.
More than 5 weeks = becoming a Mangrove friend temporarily and not being responsible for Mangrove projects anymore.

### Engagement issues
If 3 members agree on a lack of engagement from a Mangrove member, they need to talk to this member and share publicly that this talk happened.
45 days later, if 3 members (not necessarily the same ones) are still unsatisfied about this member’s engagement, they should share the information publicly and ask for a vote: “Should this member still be an  Mangrove member?". If more than 30% of the voters agree that she should become a Mangrove friend, the member becomes a Mangrove friend (= no more responsibilities within Mangrove) or can leave the community.

### Integrating new members

After sharing a retreat or a project with a Mangrove Friend, we can decide to integrate him/her to our core team.

**Deciding**

The question is raised by a Mangrove member and all members must approve it.


> When Mangrove reaches 10 members, we'll switch to 5 randomly chosen Mangrove members.

Here are the main points that must be checked before admitting someone:

1. Is he/she sharing our values? Does he/she believe in the vision we're trying to build?
2. Has he/she proved his/her will to get involved on a daily basis in the building of Mangrove in the long-term?
3. Does he/she has an entrepreneurial mindset? 
> Side projects are a good way to evaluate this.

4. Does he/she possess amazing skills in his/her field ?
5. Would it be ok to have that person as a leader of Mangrove project?

        Examples of people we don't want inside Mangrove
        - joining Mangrove to get more contracts
        - joining only because it's cool to be part of it
        - expecting to be told what to do once inside the company

**Integrating**

When the decision is taken, the member who raised the question is responsible for the integration of the new member.

Key steps:

 1. Call him/her to give the awesome news.
 2. Onboard him/her by taking the time to explain how things are going lately, and refer to this playbook.
 3. Invite to Slack, Google Drive & Trello.
 4. Make a starting point with the most MM possible
> Diner or appear.in are good options.

 6. Update meetmangrove.com/us with a PR (or ask someone who knows how to do it).
 6. Slack bots Rachid and Pairing Dancers will be updated automatically.
 7. Yeah you're done!
 8. ...but you're in charge of the trial period as well

**Trial period**

When someone joins Mangrove, he starts a trial period of 3 months. The goal is to see if the fit is real, so it work both ways (the new member might not feel good inside such an organisation for ex).

Trial steps:

1. Day 0 - Starting Point
2. Day 30 - First month review
> Gather at least 5 MM (appear.in or diner). See how things are going, both ways. At the end of the review decide to continue or to stop (go back to MF).

3. Day 90 - Final decision
> Gather at least 5 MM (appear.in or diner). See how things are going, both ways. At the end of the review decide to end the trial by giving a definitive membership or by going back to MF.


### Responsibility

Having members taking clearly defined responsibilities and assuming them is key for Mangrove. It is the condition for a flat organisation to work, and goes hand in hand with the freedom of action. There are two ways of taking a responsibility within Mangrove :
- **public responsibility**. In this option, the responsibility is publicly documented, including the deadlines or the expected outcomes (currently in Trello). The member is accountable to Mangrove is general for this, and to no one in particular. Therefore, no one should act as a manager on her or pressure her about it. It is her duty to communicate actively and regularly about the updates concerning her responsibility, and to particularly do it towards the others member who are impacted by her activity.
- **private responsibility**. Often, someone who bears an important responsibility like organising a retreat cannot do the work alone and needs the help of others. This help can sometimes be too small to be subject to a formal public responsibility, like just sending an important email. In this case, the helper takes a private responsibility towards the member having the public responsibility. He is then accountable to her for this commitment.

In both cases, the members should not be judged on the way they accomplish their works, but only on the promised outcomes.


### Projects in Mangrove

Projects are not subjects to formalism and rules like responsibilities are. Responsibilities management only is the cornerstone of Mangrove’s activity. “Project” is just a handy word to talk about a main activity that is being conducted at the moment.

A project can be handled and managed in many different ways, and include several or many members. Some examples are :
- having an identified leader responsible for its avancement, which ensures that it will be conducted to the end. This management mode is necessary when the project is really mandatory for Mangrove, on when commitments have to be taken, like when organising a monthly meeting or a retreat.
- being something that members talk about and work on, without clear management, like working on a new bot. In this case, the outcome is not guaranteed, and will be the resultant of the energy and will of the members. This is management mode is a very good way for Mangrove to listen to its inner self, instead of working on actions planned according to a strategy.


### Commissions between members
When a member brings business to another member, she/he can ask for a commission when the exchange is not equilibrated. The percentage or amount of this commission is negotiated ad hoc between the two parts, and publicly shared in Mangrove to serve as a basis for future cases. The negotiation should be based on the history of previous cases.


### Mangrove Friends
Mangrove friends are people revolving around Mangrove. They share the mindset, the vision and are interested in being part of the ecosystem. 

Some of the benefits of being a mangrove friend include:

- Being invited to the Mangrove retreats
- Being part of the Slack “Mangrove Friends” which contains several helpful services
- Pay forward / Promotion from the community
- Early announcements of Mangrove Events
- Help by experts in various subjects (copywriting, ux, code, etc)
- Pairing (if wanted) with other MF and MM


### Physical Assets

While all assets belong to Mangrove, a person is appointed as responsible for a period of time to be determined, depending on the context. Being responsible of an asset means that we have to take care of it [link to sheperding], in exchange of its use. 

When a member leaves Mangrove, he takes no assets back. He has to delegate the responsibilities he has over the physical assets to other members. A council with the other people affected by this transmission [see decision making]. 

A member cannot use Mangrove physical assets for personal use, as it doesn’t help the purpose of Mangrove. However, he can ask to affected members to buy or lease it with associated guarantees.

[Detail examples of assets here]


### Compensation & Profits
All profits generated within Mangrove should be reinvested in other Mangrove projects. (ça suppose quand même que mangrove possède un statut juridique et peut recevoir de l’argent)

When money is needed for a project, a simple validation by vote is needed to proceed to the investment. 

A treasurer has to be elected every 3 months and is hold responsible of the financial flows. He has to regularly check the #finance channel in order to register the cashflows on his favorite accounting system and publicly communicate the balances every 2 weeks, the debts of Mangrove towards its members, and the distribution of the refunds. 

[idée: faire un bot de rôles (qui assigne des rôles et des rappels associés à chaque rôle)]


### Office and hubs

**1 - The office**

Mangrove members are free to work from wherever they want. However, we have an office in Paris at the Liberté Living Lab. If you want to take a seat at this office, you’ll have to get involved in life of the Lab by introducing Mangrove regularly to different companies or by working several hours for the Lab on a monthly basis. 

**2 - Hubs**

As an MM, you’re welcome to create hubs all around the world. Mangrove hubs are gathering members in a common city. For example, if 4 members are located in Austin, TX, they can create a Mangrove hub there by finding an office and working together. 

### Conflict Resolution

Conflicts happen. It's ok.

**The conflict is about Mangrove's mission
**
- Refer to "What is Mangrove" and "The Rules" to see if you can resolve it in an easy way by following a written rule.
- Talk about it asap on #general. Transparency is one of the key values of Mangrove. No one should be affraid to express misunderstandings or divergent opinions.

**The conflict is about anything else (projects, implication...)
**

**Step 1**
- If inside a project, refer to the person in charge and talk about the problem directly on 1 to 1.
- If the problem is a lack of leadership or a wrong one, talk directly with the lead of the project about it. The sooner the better.
- For any other conflict, talk to the person that causes the conflict. Be benevolent, try to understand why this person is acting like this.

**Step 2**
- If it doesn't work, choose a third person as a facilitator. This person will be responsible of sorting things out.

**Step 3**
- If it doesn't work, talk about it publicly (either #general or during a call/meeting). Don't forget to stay benevolent. Everybody is on the same mission here, and shit happens. Talk about the project, not the people. Smile :)


### Mangrove Ownership Points
Contributing to Mangrove gives the right to accumulate Mangrove Ownership Points (MOP). This points are not legal ownership rights like are shareholder's actions, but gives you weight in Mangrove's inner workings. 
At the beginning of each month, you write a text about your contribution to the ecosystem during the month before, and attribute yourself points for that. These points are publicly shared on slack and an harmonization discussion happens there involving all the MM. If needed or if the subject is complex, an appear.in will be scheduled for this purpose.
> when the number of MM will exceed 10, this process will no more involve all the community at one time
At the end, you are free to attribute yourself the number of points you want ; but it is highly recommanded that you follow what the community suggested on this matter if it had remarks on your amount.
The points give you more weight in the decision making process


### Decision Making
Mangrove is based on freedom, transparency, and a strong sense of collectiveness. Therefore in most of the cases, you can make your own decisions, ensuring that :
1. they follow Mangrove's purpose
2. you consult the relevant advisors about them, and/or the members who will be impacted
3. your promptly inform the members about your decisions (via slack)

Nevertheless, some important decisions must be validated by the members. This is done by a vote in which the member’s weights are the amount of Mangrove Points their own. These decisions are :
1. Modifying the playbook, except for the "how to" section.
2. Making an important investment
3. Selling an asset

### Modifying the Playbook

Any MM can modify the "how to" part of the playbook. He/she must talk about the changes in #playbook.

Changes in "What is Mangrove", "Being a member" and "The rules" need the approval of the overall community (only +1 or 0, no -1).

> When we'll reach 20 members, an absolute number of point will be necessary to edit these parts.

Request access in #playbook to begin editing.
